# Intro
Sometimes I want to test the latest tech or some other things I've found on the web.
This project is based on the free to use api [Spacetraders.io](spacetraders.io) and uses some of the endpoins.

I'm testing frontend things, playing around with Twig Components or other things that I like to see working (or try to get it to work).

## Symfony Docker
I'm using the official  [Symfony Docker Image](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker)

Created by [KÃ©vin Dunglas](https://dunglas.dev), co-maintained by [Maxime Helias](https://twitter.com/maxhelias) and sponsored by [Les-Tilleuls.coop](https://les-tilleuls.coop).

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based installer and runtime for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) web framework,
with [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev) and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) inside!
